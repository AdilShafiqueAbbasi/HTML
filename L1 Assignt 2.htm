The Story in the Book
</h1>
<h2>
Chapter 1
</h2>
<p>
Molly had been staring out of her window for an hour now. on her desk,lying betweenthe copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist.</i> and all the other</br>scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy oy <i> On The Road.</i> It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she</br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
</p>
<p>
she had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have</br> nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the Ilama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly </br> <em> did </em> think she had something better to do.
